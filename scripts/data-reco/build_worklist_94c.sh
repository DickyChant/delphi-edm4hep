# Build the 94c run worklist consumed by batch_94c.sh: one line
#   "ED-VID.seq  run  Ytape1,Ytape2,..."
# per raw segment that is (a) staged on disk and (b) has matching official
# short DST(s). The 3rd column is the COMMA-JOINED set of ALL .al tapes the
# run touches.
#
# IMPORTANT: a run's official short-DST events are split across SEVERAL .al
# tape files (short94_c2.vidmap lists several lines per run, interleaved by
# event-number range, e.g. run 44393 -> Y13709.41 AND Y13709.42). Keeping the
# full tape set is what lets batch_94c.sh's pass2 union-index every event; an
# earlier version kept only one tape per run, so any raw segment whose events
# lived in a dropped tape matched 0 events and produced an empty (metadata-only)
# file.
